 * All of the graph partitioning and sparse matrix ordering routines in METIS
 * take as input the adjacency structure of the graph and the weights of the
 * vertices and edges (if any). The adjacency structure of the graph is stored
 * using the compressed storage format (CSR). The CSR format is a widely used
 * scheme for storing sparse graphs. In this format the adjacency structure of a
 * graph with n vertices and m edges is represented using two arrays xadj and
 * adjncy. The xadj array is of size n + 1 whereas the adjncy array is of size
 * 2m (this is because for each edge between vertices v and u we actually store
 * both (v; u) and (u; v)). The adjacency structure of the graph is stored as
 * follows. Assuming that vertex numbering starts from 0 (C style), then the
 * adjacency list of vertex i is stored in array adjncy starting at index
 * xadj[i] and ending at (but not including) index xadj[i + 1] (i.e.,
 * adjncy[xadj[i]] through and including adjncy[xadj[i + 1]-1]). That is, for
 * each vertex i, its adjacency list is stored in consecutive locations in the
 * array adjncy, and the array xadj is used to point to where it begins and
 * where it ends.
